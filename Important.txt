Alright so below we will find a quick run down on what must be done and all the different processes of Github including:

First, initialize repository
    press : control-shift-G or the 3 dot thing on the side
    It might ask you to choose the folder you wish to use
    otherwise, it will show you the files you have committed and those you do not(U)
    
    when creating a new folder/project call "init" in the area to type, its going to want you to assign it to a 
    remote repository(Github link you must create)

    


Pushing

Pulling

Committing

Cloning

Creating Repositories

Other?

Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
